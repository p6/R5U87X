R5U87x Userspace Tools
Version 0.2.1, 2009/11/22

Introduction
============

This project is an attempt to produce a group of useful usespace tools for
managing cameras based on Ricoh R5U87x chipsets.

You will still need to depend on such kernel drivers like uvcvideo to get the
video stream out of the device.

Supported devices
=================

See docs/model_matrix.txt

Compilation
===========

To compile the tools, it is required you have the following prerequisites
installed:

 * GCC
 * Automake
 * libusb development packages (libusb-dev or similar)
 * GLib 2.0 development packages (libglib2.0-dev or similar)

Quickstart
==========

Ubuntu
	$ sudo apt-get install libglib2.0-dev libusb-dev build-essential gcc automake git
	$ git clone https://github.com/p6/R5U87X.git
	$ cd r5u87x
	$ make
	$ sudo make install
	$ sudo r5u87x-loader --reload
	
	The loader will automatically be run on boot when it detects your webcam.

Installation from source
========================

Simply install the dependencies required above on your system, then run
'make'.
 
Now you can proceed to installing the tool system-wide:
 # make install

If you have udev installed, your system will automatically load the firmware
to the camera, and then reload the uvcvideo module at boot time.
 
Please note that the loader is installed system-wide as 'r5u87x-loader', but
compiles as just 'loader'.

You can either reboot or follow the instructions below.

Usage
=====

To upload the firmware to your camera, simply run (as root):
  # loader --reload

Do note that this only lasts while the camera still has power to it. Shutting
down and starting up again will cause the camera to lose its state. Rebooting,
however, won't.

If your camera appears to be playing up, you can try forcefully resetting it:
  # loader --force-clear

There are also useful arguments for testing, see docs/extracting_ucode.txt

Bugs
====

The following issues are known already, so please *do not* report them (you
can, however, subscribe to any of these tickets):
 * Broken pipe (code 32) - http://www.bitbucket.org/ahixon/r5u87x/issue/6/
 * Distorted/stripy video - http://www.bitbucket.org/ahixon/r5u87x/issue/17/
 * HP Pavillion dv9000 or similar aren't detected (make sure you uncomment
   only *ONE* device, not both) - http://bitbucket.org/ahixon/r5u87x/issue/26/
 * Upside down video - http://www.bitbucket.org/ahixon/r5u87x/issue/7/

Please note WDM devices WILL NOT WORK.
You can check what type of model you have by looking at the model chart found
in docs/model_matrix.txt. If you're running a WDM based device, you can try to
look on the internet for a patched version of r5u870, however it will probably
not work with more recent kernels.

You should also register, otherwise you may not get notifications of any
replies to your bug.

Report any bugs by creating a new ticket at 
http://www.bitbucket.org/ahixon/r5u87x/issues/new/. If possible, make sure
that the bug you have hasn't already been reported by searching the issue list.

Acknowledgements
================

Huge kudos to Sam Revitch for writing the original r5u870 driver.
Additional thanks to those who helped Sam develop the driver.

Many thanks to Willem van Engen for working on getting this included into
Ubuntu, as well as helping me with my Makefile writing, writing the udev
template and awk/sed scripts, and creating a Debian package.

Thanks to Gonzalo Alvarez for testing the 1812 driver and providing usbsnoop
traces of the device.

Thanks to Utz-Uwe Haus for getting the Sony VGP-VCC7 firmware extracted, and
providing a patch against the original r5u870 driver, and providing the
recode-fw.scm script.

Some friendly folk on the Ubuntu Forums for providing extracted version of
firmwares and their associated version numbers.

Thanks to 'franz' for providing an updated version of 183b driver, and testing.
